# InternalConstantsNamespace

This is a tiny project that shows a pair of alternatives to work with constants in a project. The goal is to have constants grouped, easy to access and have a similar behavior to namespaces. The original idea was fount in a [CocoaCasts article](https://cocoacasts.com/namespaces-in-swift/).
