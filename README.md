# Swift exercises

I use this repository to upload some examples, exercises, and mini-projects that I use to practice iOS development with Swift. The exercises are not related to any particular subject, they are just problems that at a certain time I considered interesting and/or useful.  

Currently, the majority of the exercises are updated to Swift 4, but since this is just an informal repository that I use to practice, surely some of them will get deprecated at some point.

## Exercises list:
1. **[GrandCentralDispath](GrandCentralDispatch/)**: A collection of examples that use GCD to perform an operation synchronously and asynchronously, perform many concurrent tasks in the background, use different priorities, etc.
2. **[AsyncAutoSuggestExample](AsyncAutoSuggestExample/)**: An app that asynchronously downloads names of different companies meanwhile the user writes the name (an example of the use of `DispatchWorkItem`).
3. **[BlurEffect](BlurEffect/)**: Example of the use of `UIBlurEffect` in a view. It uses a storyboard and it's also made programmatically.
4. **[AutoresizingMasks](AutoresizingMasks/)**: Contains different examples of the use of the `autoresizingMask` property of an `UIView`.
5. **[Generics](Generics/)**: Differents examples of the use of Generics in Swift 4.
6. **[Strings](Strings/)**: A playground with different examples of the use of strings in Swift 4.
