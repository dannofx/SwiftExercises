# SwiftExercises

This repo contains some exercises and notes that I have made meanwhile I practice programming with Swift, it doesn't contain anything meaningful and has not the best organization.

At the moment, the examples that the repo contains are:

1. **GrandCentralDispatch:** Several examples of the use of sync/async operations with different DispatchQueue, as well as other features of GCD.
2. **AsyncAutoSuggestExample:** An app that asynchronously downloads names of different companies meanwhile the user writes the name (example of the use of `DispatchWorkItem`).
3. **GlassEffect:** Example of the use of `UIBlurEffect` in a view, using storyboard and made programmatically.
4. **AutoresizingMasks:** Different examples of the use of the `autoresizingMask` property of an `UIView`.
5. **Generics:** Differents examples of the use of Generics in Swift 3 (The new features for Swift 4 are commented).
6. **Strings:** A playground with different examples of the use of strings in Swift 4.
