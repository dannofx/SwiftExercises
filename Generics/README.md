# Generics

Definitions and test of several structs and protocols implementing generics. It's basically a compilation of the examples shown in the [Apple Generics guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Generics.html), with the difference that all the examples are in one single project and it adds some other features like iterators.
